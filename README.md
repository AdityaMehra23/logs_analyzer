## Data Source
The project utilizes the modified dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnu0399/server-logs

## Description
The Real-time Log Data Processing and Visualization Pipeline for Apache Web Server Access Logs is a comprehensive solution designed to ingest, process, store, and present log data generated by Apache web servers. This project leverages a range of AWS services to provide real-time insights, historical data storage, and interactive visualization to enhance the understanding of web server access patterns and performance.

## Use-cases
Enhanced Monitoring: Real-time access to web server access logs enables administrators to proactively identify and address issues, improving server reliability and performance. Dashboards also provide a better way of visualization of data compared to querying the databases.
Data-Driven Insights: Historical data analysis done on the data lake provides valuable insights into user behavior, traffic patterns, and potential security threats, enhancing decision-making.


## Core Components and Design
<img src="/img/app_design.png">
The data pipeline encompasses several components. A Producer runs on an EC2 instance to simulate a real-time environment, producing Apache web server access logs, and feeding them into an Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) cluster. Spark Streaming on Amazon EMR is used for real-time data processing. Cassandra KeySpaces is used for efficient real-time data storage. An Amazon S3 data lake is used for long-term storage and complex querying that would not be feasible on Cassandra. We can also consider using Hive. A Flask-based application is hosted on an EC2 instance to provide a RESTful API layer for data retrieval, and the presentation layer is also made up of an EC2 instance. We can add Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group for high availability and scalability. This architecture ensures real-time insights, historical analysis, scalability, and user-friendly data visualization for web server access logs, offering valuable monitoring and analytical capabilities.
